# signal-plotting-using-matlab-GUI
I have plotted four types of signals they are sine signal, square signal, triangular signal, and composite signal by signal plotting using matlab GUI 
Signal Plotting using MATLAB GUI: This task involves plotting four different types of signals using MATLAB's Graphical User Interface (GUI). The signals to be plotted are:
1. Sine signal: generated using MATLAB's sin function.
2. Square signal: created using the square function.
3. Triangular signal: produced using the sawtooth function.
4. Composite signal: obtained by adding the above signals together.

The task of plotting the four signals (sine, square, triangular, and composite) using MATLAB's GUI was successfully completed using MATLAB version 2016a.
